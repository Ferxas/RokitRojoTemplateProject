# Rojo + Wally Project Template for Roblox Studio Projects

This project is based on [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) v7.5.1, a tool that allows you to sync your local file system with Roblox Studio, and [Wally](https://wally.run), a package manager for the Roblox Lua ecosystem.

## ðŸ“¦ What's Included?

- Organized project structure with reusable modules.
- Dependency management via Wally.
- Real-time syncing with Roblox Studio using Rojo.
- Ideal for frameworks like [Knit](https://github.com/Sleitnick/Knit) or [Cmdr](https://github.com/evaera/Cmdr).
